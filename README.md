# 15 Seconds Online ADB Installer and Updater (JP)
## About this
This is an online update-compatible version of the tool to set up ADB and Fastboot in about 15 seconds, which was previously troublesome to install.

Previously, due to outdated components being included, issues such as ADB and Fastboot remaining outdated and unable to use new commands, or unable to perform data wipes, were encountered.

However, this tool downloads the latest version from Google's server, installs the latest version, and enables updates.
## Changes
- Japanese language support for the tool
- Correction of driver download links (previously not pointing to the latest version's download location)
